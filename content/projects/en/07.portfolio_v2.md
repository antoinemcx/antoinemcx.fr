# Story

Made in 2023, the first version of my portfolio *antoinemcx.fr* was made with EJS and Express.  
This site was mainly used as a showcase for my projects, as well as file hosting.

It follows on from a previous site, [*meliooff.xyz*](https://github.com/antoinemcx/antoinemcx.fr/tree/archive/v1-meliooff.xyz-ejs), which was much more simplistic.
A few years later, I decided to redesign the site because it was becoming outdated – outdated technologies, legacy code, outdated information –, which is why you are now viewing this new site.

# Overview

The website includes a portfolio home page, **some tools** – URL shortener, image uploader, an API with image generation, and more.

# Discord bot

Originally, the source code also contained a Discord bot. It has been moved to this project: [melio-coding-bot](/projects/melio_coding_bot).
