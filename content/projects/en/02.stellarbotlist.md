[StellarBotList](https://stellarbotlist.com) (SBL) is a Discord Bots referrer.

# API and Webhook

Every owner of a listed bot has access to an API to retrieve information about their bot and check if a user has upvoted for it ‚Äì feature for better referencing of active bots.
Endpoints have to be accessed with a token, linked to the bot, that can be regenerated. 

The two available endpoints are the following :  
`https://stellarbotlist.com/api/checkvote/:userID`  
`https://stellarbotlist.com/api/bots/:botID`  

Additionally, I made a webhook system to receive HTTP POST notifications so bot owners can know when someone votes for their bot.  
For this, you need to go to your bot settings page and enter your webhook URL and token.

# Community

Although SBL remains primarily focused on its website, facilitating the search for bots, it also aims to **foster a community around bot development and usage**.
This includes providing resources, support, and a platform for developers to connect and collaborate.  

In this way, a [Discord Server](https://stellarbotlist.com/discord) has been created to gather developers and bot users, as well as providing a preview of listed bots.  
**Feel free to join us** and participate in the discussions!
