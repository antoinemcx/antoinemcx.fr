Available in English and French, Meliodas is **the only bot you need** for your discord server.  
It allows you to **manage and moderate your server**, it has **utility** and **fun** commands, and much more !

# Story

When I discovered programming with JavaScript, developing Discord bots immediately intrigued me.   
I started by creating a small bot with discord.js, both for fun and to improve my skills.  

As I went along, I added new features, becoming more and more numerous.  
I then decided to make the bot public and share it with the community, and that's how Meliodas was born.  

Over the years, Meliodas has evolved into a multi-functional bot available in two languages: English and French.  
It now has a dozen command categories, a hundred commands, and **more than 500 servers** using it.

# Commands

For now, Meliodas has **more than 150 slash commands** and sub-commands, divided into several categories.
