# Story

Over the years, I have developed several versions of my personal website, which has always been used to showcase my projects.  

In 2021, when I was still in middle school, I developed my first website, [*meliooff.xyz*](https://github.com/antoinemcx/antoinemcx.fr/tree/archive/v0-meliooff.xyz-ejs), built with EJS, which was quite simple with a design inspired by Discord profiles.  
Then, in 2023, this time in high school, I decided to redesign the site — and change the domain name — so that it could be truly useful to me.
I thus developed the [first version](/projects/portfolio_v2) of *antoinemcx.fr*, still with EJS, which served as a showcase for my projects, file hosting, and contained utility tools (URL shortener, image generator, API, etc.).

Following a desire to discover more modern technologies, I became interested in React.js and thus [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
As the first version of *antoinemcx.fr* was becoming obsolete, in 2024 I developed a much more modern [second version](https://github.com/antoinemcx/antoinemcx.fr/tree/archive/v2-antoinemcx-nextjs) of my portfolio, using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Motion.
Time passed and I abandoned the idea of finishing this version in favor of other personal projects and my studies.

Finally, in my second year of a University Technological Bachelor in Computer Science, in 2025, I completed [an internship](/about) that introduced me to [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com), a framework based on Vue.js.
That same year, I decided to use this framework to develop the **third version** of my portfolio, which is the one you are currently viewing.  
I also proceeded to make the new version, as well as all previous mentioned versions, **open source** [on GitHub](https://github.com/antoinemcx/antoinemcx.fr).
