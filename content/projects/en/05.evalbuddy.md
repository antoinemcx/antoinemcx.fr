EvalBuddy is a web-based application built with Nuxt 3 that provides educators with a comprehensive tool for **evaluating responses to questions**.
The platform supports multiple **evaluation methodologies**, from simple binary assessments to complex mastery-level evaluations with custom scoring systems.

The tool uses [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB) for local data storage, ensuring fast and reliable performance with **100% local data handling**.

# Usage Guide

A detailed usage guide is available in the [GitHub README file](https://github.com/remisaurel/evalbuddy/).

# My contribution

In 2025, I completed an internship, which was extended by a fixed-term contract, at the [IRIT](https://irit.fr/en/home/) laboratory ([read more by clicking here](/about)).  
During this time, I was mainly supervised by [Rémi Saurel](https://remisaurel.dev), who was at the time working on his thesis on **Technology-Enhanced Learning**.

Rémi developed the first version of EvalBuddy in his spare time, an application designed to facilitate the evaluation of student responses.
Indeed, the evaluation of **large quantities of responses** is a frequent occurrence during **scientific experiments** on education; EvalBuddy facilitates the work of human evaluators, whether they are involved in experiments or even researchers themselves.

Eager to participate in a new project related to education, I decided to contribute to the application, as it is open-source.  
I particularly worked on improving the overall **user experience**, as well as making the dataset more flexible to feed into the application.
