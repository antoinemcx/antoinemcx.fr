# Story

**Project Amboise** is a shooting game set in a 3D model of [Sainte-Marie](https://www.ensemble-scolaire-amboise.fr/lycee-amboise/) (a school in Albi, France).
This project, created in our senior year by two friends and myself, was also intended to help finance the **2022-2023 prom**.

I myself developed this website, which was used to present the project and the game, and to enable its purchase â€“ via the [PayPal SDK](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/).
