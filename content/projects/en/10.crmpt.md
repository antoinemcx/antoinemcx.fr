# Story

At the end of high school, a friend – [Mathéo Allabert](https://matheoallabert.com/) – and I had a somewhat *crazy* idea of a virtual currency that could be earned by watching advertisements.
I developed this modern-looking website to easily explain our project.

We discussed it with entrepreneurs and even conducted a survey to gather the opinions of students and staff at our respective universities.  
However, the project remained rather shaky, we didn't like it that much, and we eventually abandoned it.

I'm presenting it here in my portfolio because the site I coded still gave me good training in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and smooth [Motion](https://motion.dev/) animations.

# Overview

The website is still online at the moment, but it will not remain so indefinitely. You can preview it here: [https://crmpt.antoinemcx.fr](https://crmpt.antoinemcx.fr).
